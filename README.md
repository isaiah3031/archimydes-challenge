### The hardest part was

Leaving things undone to meet the deadline. Still code isn't the type of thing you can tweak until the very last minute.

Learning to communicate with the API. There was a little more auth work to be done on the frontend side than I'm used to. Submitting auth headers and remembering to set the content type fixed this problem. 

Also looking through the API files gave me a little hope because of how readable it was. I can definetly see some similarities between Express and Rails.

## Overall

I'm sure I could do more with this if given more time. The functionality is all there I believe but it looks like it was designed by a developer. The AdobeXD files I made yesterday were pretty minimalistic but I abandoned some of the more elaborate ones to make sure I had time to submit everything.

This project helped me realize how much further I've came since building my portfolio project. Which of course means I need to create some new things that are more representative of my skills. 

Thank you for the opportunity!
