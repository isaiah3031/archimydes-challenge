### The most challenging part was

Leaving things unstyled or not styled the way I wanted in favor of reaching the deadline. I did this because tweaking things up to the last minute seems risky.

## Overall

I'm sure I could do more with this if given more time. The functionality is all there, I believe, but it looks like a developer designed it. The AdobeXD files I made yesterday were pretty minimalistic, but I abandoned some of the more elaborate ones to make sure I had time to submit everything.

This project helped me realize how much further I've come since building my portfolio project. So, I plan to create some new projects for my portfolio that will represent my skills more. 

Thank you for the opportunity!
